    <h2>Thomas Austin Barnes IV</h2>
    <h3>A.K.A Austin</h3>
    <p>I am Thomas, but I go by my middle name Austin! 
        This is because I share my name with my father and grandfather.
        I am from Idaho Falls, Idaho in a family of five kids, being the second oldest. We have a cute dog named Penny too!
        We are a huge soccer family with all but one sibling playing soccer. I love playing and watching soccer a lot!

        I am studying to become a software engineer as I am in my third semester here at BYU-I. 
        While I study I have the incredible opportunity to work with special-needs kids!
        They are great kids that are absolutely awesome to be around!
        I am very excited to learn website development to expand my abilities of what I can do with a computer!
